## Zui.fi
I have made this blog as a hobby. It combines my interest in travel with my interest in programming.

## Used technologies in this project
- PHP
- MySQL
- Laravel
- React
- Sass
- Bootstrap 4
- Font Awesome

Create development environment
1. clone repository https://github.com/Zuip/zuifi-public_html to the root directory of this repository
2. run "npm install" in root directory of this repository

## Testing

Running tests
- Run in command line when in root directory: "php phpunit.phar -c blog/phpunit.xml"

Creating new test cases or mocks
- Run in command line when in root directory: "composer dump-autoload"
  * This autoloads the new files so that they don't need to be included in the actual code files
